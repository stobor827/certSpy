# certSpy

Goal is to have an icon that changes color based on if a specific root cert is in use.
May also add request blocking based on domain matching.

I'm suspicious of MITM appliances and want to know if my employer turns one on before trusting the OS store.

Started from the root-cert-stats example here: https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples
